            <h3>Born In Utah</h3>
                    <img src="images/Utah.webp" alt="family foto 1">
                    <p>I was born in Orem, Utah. I used to live on 1600N which was right of the freeway so I have always loved the sounds of a buisy city. 
                        I used to bike around the city just to explore areas I didn't know about before. My love for exploring also was because of my many family 
                        vacations and travels to Maine. I traveled back and forth between Utah and Main to visit my Mom when my parents divorced when I was 3. 
                        Most of my Summers and later years I also lived in Utah where I had my Middle and High School Education. 
                    </p>
            <h3>Raised in Maine</h3>
                    <img src="images/Maine.webp" alt="family foto 1">
                    <p>I grew up as a kid in the small town of Corinth, Maine. This is where I learned to Bike and Garden with my Mom, and play chess with my Grandpa.
                         I have many fond memories in Maine and many of these places give me nostalgia of a simple life. The only thing that I didn't like was how 
                         you always had to drive for at least half an hour to get anywhere in Maine. 
                    </p>

            <h3>How I Got To TES (Technology and Engineering Studies)</h3>
            <p>I used to be in the Mechanical Engineering Program at BYU before I changed to the TES major. I knew I wanted to have the freedom to be able to design 
                and build things in my career, but Mechanical Engineering didn't have what I wanted. I wanted to design more that calculate the strength of a structure or the thermo dynamics.
                 I looked through every program at BYU to find something with more design freedom and the best fit was TES. It not only did't require thermo dynamics, but it had classes with more 
                 hands on projects that I got to design on my own. It also gave me the freedom to get a minor in manufacturing so I could have the knowlegde to manufacture what I design. This may 
                 be hard to explain in a job interview in the future, but for now it's exactly what I want to learn.

            <h3>Where I'm Going With My Future</h3>
            <p>I have a few important goals for my futer set in stone including; Get a career to suport a family, get married in the Temple, and become a Dad. My methods of acheiving there goals is still undecided.
                 I hope to find a good internship in manufacturing after I graduate that will help to start out my carrer. Some of my other careers I would like to try out include; product design, themed entertainment engineering, and even a polot. 
                 I haven't decided which of these to persue 100%. One plan of mine is to save money while doing manufacturig to go to pilot school and become a comercial pilot. I'm not yet sure of all the pros and cons of this plan, but its something I know is still possible.
